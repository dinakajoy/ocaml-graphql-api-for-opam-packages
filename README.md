# opam-paackages

A short, but powerful statement about your project

## Setup your development environment

1. (Optional) Create an opam [local switch](https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-20-tips/#Local-switches) by running:

```bash
make create_switch
```

_Note: you can ignore this step if you prefer to use the global opam switch._

2. Get all dependencies:

```bash
make dev
```

3. Build and start a local server:

```bash
make start
```
